# KotlinProjectSkeleton
This is my approach to create base project skeleton for Android project. I was really tired of Ctrl+C -> Ctrl+V from my old projects.

This skeleton includes:
Dagger2, Retrofit2 (with Moshi adapter), Glide, RxJava2 and some of Android Architecture Components

And all bundled with MVVM architecture
